Vehicle Emissions Data Visualization
This project uses the vehicle_emissions.csv dataset to explore and visualize patterns in vehicle emissions using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn). The visualizations include:

Histogram of CO2 emissions by fuel type

Scatter plot of engine size vs CO2 emissions

Box plot of CO2 emissions across emission categories

Bar chart of average CO2 emissions by fuel type

Violin plot showing the distribution of emissions per fuel type

Line plot for average CO2 emissions grouped by engine size bins

Correlation heatmap between numeric variables

KDE plot comparing emission densities by fuel type

These plots help in understanding emission trends, fuel efficiency, and the relationship between vehicle attributes and their environmental impact.
